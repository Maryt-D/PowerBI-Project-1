### Recommendation

- Examine any state laws or guidelines from states with low discharge rates that may have an impact on how patients are discharged. We can then advocate for modifications or changes if necessary.
- Promote the healthcare services offered by facilities in these states by using marketing and community outreach strategies. Making sure that prospective patients are aware of the medical services that are being offered.
- To find the best practices and strategies for improvement, contrast the healthcare facilities in states with low discharge rates to those in states with higher discharge rates.
